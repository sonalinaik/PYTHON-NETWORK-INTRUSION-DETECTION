# PYTHON-NETWORK-INTRUSION-DETECTION
With the enormous growth of computer networks usage and the huge increase in the number of applications running on top of it, network security is becoming increasingly more  important.  All the computer systems suffer from security vulnerabilities which are both technically difficult and economically costly to be solved by the manufacturers. Therefore, the role of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), as special-purpose devices to detect anomalies and attacks in the network, is becoming more important.

## BUSINESS PROBLEM:

Your task to build network intrusion detection system to detect anamolies and attacks in the network. There are two problems.

1.	Binomial Classification: Activity is normal or attack
2.	Multinomial classification: Activity is normal or DOS or PROBE or R2L or U2R

Please note that, currently the dependent variable (target variable) is not definied explicitly. However, you can use attack variable to define the target variable as required.

## DATA AVAILABILITY:

This data is KDDCUPâ€™99 data set, which is widely used as one of the few publicly available data sets for network-based anomaly detection systems.
